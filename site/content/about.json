  "background-primary": "I was born on October 18, 2001, in Cleveland, Ohio to businessman Daniel Morgan and nurse LaVonne Morgan. However, I was raised in different parts of Northeast Ohio and attended five different schools while participating in many activities with numerous small achievements. Although I participated in many activities with numerous small achievements in the schools I attended, participating in activities with small achievements also happened outside of school which is one of the things that shaped me to become the young man I am today. I don’t claim to be better than any creation either I am just different. Currently, I have two preeminent younger siblings named Jason Morgan and Josiah Morgan in high school and elementary school.",

I’m so grateful and blessed by God to have you all in my life and out of my life. Part of my success then, currently, and in the future is because of all of you. Much love and blessings to you all.",
  "mission": "My mission is to simply plant and build onto every seed that God has given me the ability to do for Him, others, and myself.

Through my conscience, words, and actions I have the propensity to live an exuberant and adventurous life for myself and my Creator during this “dash period”.",
