                                    My mission is to simply plant and build onto
                                    every seed that God has given me the ability
                                    to do for Him, others, and myself. In this
                                    current world that I have been given the
                                    opportunity to live in, I’ll continuously
                                    pursue to become an effective leader and
                                    follower. Through my conscience, words, and
                                    actions I have the propensity to live an
                                    exuberant and adventurous life for myself
                                    and my Creator during this “dash period”.

                                    The name “Daniel” comes from the root of the
                                    Hebrew language meaning “God is my Judge.”
                                    For myself, each letter of “D A N I E L” has
                                    its unique representation.

                                    I was born on October 18, 2001, in
                                    Cleveland, Ohio to businessman Daniel Morgan
                                    and nurse LaVonne Morgan. However, I was
                                    raised in different parts of Northeast Ohio
                                    and attended five different schools while
                                    participating in many activities with
                                    numerous small achievements. Although I
                                    participated in many activities with
                                    numerous small achievements in the schools I
                                    attended, participating in activities with
                                    small achievements also happened outside of
                                    school which is one of the things that
                                    shaped me to become the young man I am
                                    today. I don’t claim to be better than any
                                    creation either I am just different.
                                    Currently, I have two preeminent younger
                                    siblings named Jason Morgan and Josiah
                                    Morgan in high school and elementary school.
