            "Danny is one of the best people I have worked with both as a college student and a friend. When he sets his mind to something, he does it, he’s a real doer. Working with him for the past few years has been one of the best experiences I have had in a long time, when it comes to getting things done effectively, efficiently, and organized. I would recommend Danny to anyone when it comes to needing a good worker and a leader.",

            "Daniel, a man of integrity. To me, this means I can count on him if I need to bounce a business idea off his brain or talk from a spiritual point of view. He has a kind spirit and has a strong presence yet a gentle voice. He is not afraid to voice his opinions on any subject we discuss. When I’m talking to Daniel, it’s like speaking to one of my peers hard to believe he’s just 18. We share a love for God, fashion, and entrepreneurship. I often look at him in a room and think to myself Daniel is a living legend.",

            "Dan is very ambitious, smart, creative, gentle, but aggressive. Whatever he wants he gets and nothing can stop him. He’s caring, happy, mature, and has a lot going for himself at a very young age. I enjoyed working with Dan and I am still very grateful to have had the chance to work with him. He takes control. The only thing I will say is Dan needs to practice patience because when he jumps he jumps. Everything is baby steps.",

            "Daniel Morgan Jr., or Dan the man, is a super great guy. He is very determined and can work countless hours until he knows what he needs to be done is done. He is very smart and still loves to gain knowledge in any form he can. Daniel is also very reliable.",

        content:
            "Dan is the extroverted multitalented man who has a bright future ahead of him. I’m 22 years old and felt as if Dan has surpassed me in the age of how knowledgeable and educated he is. I think he is very tedious and enjoys helping others with his input. He can be a tad bit controlling, but that’s anyone who sees the best in something. If I had a chance to work with Dan again it’d be a pleasure.",

He looks to the future and becomes inspired by the world around him. Abhijit Naskar once stated, “It is only your dedication towards our passion that distinguishes a champion from the crowd.” In conclusion, Dan, keep being who you are because you are growing to be a great boss and a wonderful person.",
